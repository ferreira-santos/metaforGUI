# metaforGUI
## Description
The `metaforGUI` package provides a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for the R meta-analysis package `[metafor](http://www.metafor-project.org/)` by [Wolfgang Viechtbauer](http://www.wvbauer.com/), supporting basic functionality (load dataset, select variables, run analysis) and primarily developed as a teaching resource for teaching fundamental meta-analytic principles and procedures to students that are not necessarily proficient with R.

## Status
In early development (working, but still under testing).

Development version may be installed within R using the `devtools` R package. Use the following code:

```R
install.packages("devtools") # if needed
library("devtools")
install_github("ferreira-santos/metaforGUI")
```
